          <h3>Steps to prepare hamburger Stroganoff</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cook and stir beef, mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a large
              nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until beef is browned and
              crumbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour; cook and stir until combined,
              about 2 minutes. Stir in broth, condensed soup, Worcestershire
              sauce, pepper, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and
              simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 15
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you reduce the heat, bring a large pot of lightly salted
              water to a boil. Add noodles, return to a boil, and cook,
              uncovered and stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
              bite, about 6 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix sour cream and horseradish together in a bowl. Stir into beef
              mixture and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Serve over noodles.
