          <h3>Steps to prepare Party Meat Balls</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a sheet
              pan with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and
              cook onion until softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook
              until fragrant, 1 minute more. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine Italian sausage, ground beef, bread crumbs, cooked bacon,
              egg, salt, pepper, and the contents of the skillet in a bowl.
              Using your fingers, combine ingredients until they are well mixed.
              Form into about 14 meatballs, 2 inches in diameter, and place on
              the prepared sheet pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 20
              to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
              center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
              While the meatballs are baking, make the glaze. Combine water,
              maple syrup, soup base, and cayenne pepper in a 10-inch, nonstick
              skillet over medium high heat. Bring to a boil and reduce heat
              slightly. Boil until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove glaze from heat and allow to cool. Use a rubber spatula to
              scrape down any syrup that clings to the sides of the skillet, and
              stir back into the glaze.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place meatballs in a serving dish and drizzle glaze over each
              meatball. Top with cooked, crumbled bacon and serve warm with
              toothpicks.
            </li>
          </ol>
